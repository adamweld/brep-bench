A cylinder of radius 5 on the z axis, from z = 0 to z = 10. Round the circular edge around its
top face to radius 5, the cylinder's own radius.

The ball rolling around the rim has its center on the axis, at (0, 0, 5), so the top face shrinks
to nothing and the round is a hemisphere of radius 5 centered there, tangent to the cylinder's
side along the circle at z = 5. The solid is a cylinder from z = 0 to z = 5 under that dome, its
top the point (0, 0, 10).

**As a set:**

$$\{\,\rho \le 5,\ 0 \le z \le 5\,\} \cup \bigl(B_5(0,0,5) \cap \{\,z \ge 5\,\}\bigr)$$
