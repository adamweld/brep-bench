A cube from the origin to (20, 20, 20) with a notch cut from one corner: the cube from
(10, 10, 10) to (20, 20, 20) removed. The notch's three inside faces, on the planes x = 10,
y = 10 and z = 10, meet in three concave edges, each 10 long, which all start at the inside corner
(10, 10, 10) and run out to the cube's faces x = 20, y = 20 and z = 20.

Round the three concave edges to radius 3, all at once. Each round is a concave quarter cylinder
of radius 3 tangent to the two inside faces it joins, and where all three meet, at the inside
corner, the corner is filled by an eighth of a sphere of radius 3 centered at (13, 13, 13),
tangent to all three faces, which each round runs into tangentially. As a composition: the
material added is every point of the notch that no ball of radius 3 lying inside the notch can
reach.

The result is the notched cube with that material added: along each edge a strip of section
(1 − π/4)·9, and at the corner the cube from (10, 10, 10) to (13, 13, 13) less the eighth of the
ball.

**As a set:**

$$[0,20]^3 \setminus \bigl((O \ominus B_3) \oplus B_3\bigr), \quad O = \{\,x \ge 10,\ y \ge 10,\ z
\ge 10\,\}$$
