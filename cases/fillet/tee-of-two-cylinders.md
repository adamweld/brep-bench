A tee of two solid cylinders joined: the cross bar, the cylinder of radius 6 about the x axis from
x = −20 to x = 20; and the stem, the cylinder of radius 3 about the z axis from z = 0 to z = 15,
standing up out of the bar. The stem's side meets the bar's side in a closed saddle-shaped curve,
the junction, which rises and falls between z = √27 (over y = ±3) and z = 6 (over x = ±3).

Round the junction to radius 1. The round is the concave blend between the two cylinders' sides,
the surface a ball of radius 1 sweeps as it rolls around the junction touching both: neither
cylinder's axis is the other's, so the round is no torus, and its section changes all the way
round.

Neither the round's volume nor its area has a closed form, so the case is unsettled until two
kernels agree.
