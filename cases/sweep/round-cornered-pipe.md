A pipe of circular section swept along a path with one sharp corner, the section carried around
the corner by turning it about the corner.

The path: two straight runs, from (−30, 0, 0) along +x to the origin, then turning a right angle
to the left and on along +y to (0, 30, 0).

The section: a disk of radius 3, square to the path and centered on it.

Each run is the disk swept straight along it, ending flat at the corner, in the plane through
the origin square to the run. Inside the corner the two runs overlap. The wedge they leave open
outside the corner (x ≥ 0, y ≤ 0) is filled by the disk turned about the vertical line through
the corner, the z axis, a quarter turn from square to the first run to square to the second:
that is a quarter of the ball of radius 3 about the origin. So the pipe is every point within 3
of the path, cut off flat at its ends, (−30, 0, 0) and (0, 30, 0), by the planes there square to
the path.

**As a set:**

$$\{\,p : d(p, \gamma) \le 3,\ x \ge -30,\ y \le 30\,\}, \quad \gamma = \text{the path, from }
(-30,0,0) \text{ to } (0,0,0) \text{ to } (0,30,0)$$
