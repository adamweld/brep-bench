A rod, the cylinder of radius 5 about the z axis from z = 0 to z = 20, with a round-bottomed helical
groove cut around it by a ball of radius 1. The ball's center follows a helix of radius 5 about the
z axis, so it runs on the rod's surface: it starts at (5, 0, −2), turns right-handed (from +x toward
+y) and rises 4 each turn, for six whole turns, ending at (5, 0, 22). The ball is clear of the rod at
both ends. Cut from the rod everything the ball passes through.

Neighboring turns of the groove do not meet: they are 4 apart and the ball is 2 across.

**As a set:**

$$\{\,\rho \le 5,\ 0 \le z \le 20\,\} \setminus \bigcup_{\theta \in [0,\,2160^\circ]}
B_1\bigl(5\cos\theta,\ 5\sin\theta,\ -2 + 4\,\tfrac{\theta}{360^\circ}\bigr)$$
