The elliptic cylinder of `geometry/elliptic-cylinder`, the ellipse x²/25 + y²/9 ≤ 1 in the plane
z = 0 extruded straight up to z = 10, grown by 1: the solid of every point within 1 of it.

The ends move to z = −1 and z = 11. The side moves out along its normals to the curve at distance
1 outside the ellipse, which is no ellipse (an offset of an ellipse is not a conic, nor even
rational), extruded from z = 0 to z = 10. Each rim becomes the outer quarter of a tube of radius 1
about the rim's ellipse: a canal surface whose spine is an ellipse, not a torus.

E is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind, of parameter m = 1 − b²/a² = 16/25, so p is
the ellipse's perimeter; M is the side's mean curvature integrated over it, πh, plus each rim's
length times half its turning angle, π/4.

**As a set:**

$$\{\,\tfrac{x^2}{25} + \tfrac{y^2}{9} \le 1,\ 0 \le z \le 10\,\} \oplus B_{1}$$
