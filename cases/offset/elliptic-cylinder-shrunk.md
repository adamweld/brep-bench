The elliptic cylinder of `geometry/elliptic-cylinder`, the ellipse x²/25 + y²/9 ≤ 1 in the plane
z = 0 extruded straight up to z = 10, shrunk by 1: the solid of every point at least 1 from its
outside.

The ends move to z = 1 and z = 9, and the edges stay sharp. The side moves in along its normals to
the curve at distance 1 inside the ellipse, which is no ellipse, extruded from z = 1 to z = 9. The
ellipse curves most tightly at the ends of its long axis, (±5, 0), with radius of curvature
b²/a = 1.8; moved in by 1, less than that, the curve stays smooth, and the area inside it and its
length follow from the ellipse's own (Steiner): πab − pd + πd² and p − 2πd.

E is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind, of parameter m = 1 − b²/a² = 16/25, so p is
the ellipse's perimeter.

**As a set:**

$$\{\,\tfrac{x^2}{25} + \tfrac{y^2}{9} \le 1,\ 0 \le z \le 10\,\} \ominus B_{1}$$
