The block from (−15, −15, 0) to (15, 15, 20), bored right through along the z axis by a hole
of radius 6.

Draft the hole's wall by 3°, with the pull direction +z and the neutral plane z = 0, the block's
floor: the wall becomes a cone through the hole's circle of radius 6 at z = 0, leaning 3° from the
z direction, away from the axis as it rises, so that the hole widens toward the top. The block's
faces are not drafted; the hole's circle in the top face grows to meet the cone.

The result is the block less a frustum of a cone: radius 6 at z = 0 and 6 + 20·tan 3° ≈ 7.048 at
z = 20.

**As a set:**

$$\bigl([-15,15]^2\times[0,20]\bigr) \setminus \{\,\rho \le 6 + z\tan 3^\circ\,\}$$
