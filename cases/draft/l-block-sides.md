An L-shaped block: the outline through (0, 0), (30, 0), (30, 10), (10, 10), (10, 25) and
(0, 25) in the plane z = 0, extruded from z = 0 to z = 12. Its six sides meet along five convex
vertical edges and one concave one, through (10, 10).

Draft all six sides by 6°, with the pull direction +z and the neutral plane z = 0, the plane of
its floor: each side turns about its bottom edge until it leans 6° from the z direction, inward as
it rises, away from the side that the block's material is not on. The floor and the top are not
drafted; the top is trimmed to the drafted sides, and the sides meet one another along new edges
where their planes cross, the two at the concave edge too.

The result has eight faces. Its section at height z is the L moved d = z·tan 6° into its material,
each side parallel to itself: the outline through (d, d), (30 − d, d), (30 − d, 10 − d),
(10 − d, 10 − d), (10 − d, 25 − d) and (d, 25 − d).

**As a set:**

$$\bigl\{\,(x,y) \in
\operatorname{poly}\bigl((d,d),(30-d,d),(30-d,10-d),(10-d,10-d),(10-d,25-d),(d,25-d)\bigr),\ 0 \le z
\le 12\,\bigr\}, \quad d = z\tan 6^\circ$$
