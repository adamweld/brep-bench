A square plate from (−20, −20, 0) to (20, 20, 5), and on it a cylindrical boss of radius 8
about the z axis, from z = 5 to z = 17, united with the plate.

Draft the boss's side by 4°, with the pull direction +z and the neutral plane z = 5, the plate's
top face, where the boss stands: the side becomes a cone through the boss's circle of radius 8 at
z = 5, leaning 4° from the z direction, inward as it rises. The plate and the boss's top are not
drafted; the top shrinks to meet the cone.

The result is the plate with a frustum of a cone on it: radius 8 at z = 5 and
8 − 12·tan 4° ≈ 7.161 at its top, z = 17.

**As a set:**

$$\bigl([-20,20]^2\times[0,5]\bigr) \cup \{\,\rho \le 8 - (z-5)\tan 4^\circ,\ 5 \le z \le 17\,\}$$
