The box from the origin to (20, 12, 10). Draft its four sides by 5°, with the pull
direction +z and the neutral plane z = 5, halfway up: each side turns about the line where it
crosses z = 5 until it leans 5° from the z direction, inward as it rises. So below z = 5 each side
moves out, and above it each side moves in. The floor and the top are not drafted: the floor grows
to meet the drafted sides, and the top shrinks to meet them.

The result is a frustum of a rectangular pyramid, with six faces. Its section at height z is the
box's own rectangle, from (0, 0) to (20, 12), inset (z − 5)·tan 5° on every side: outset
5·tan 5° ≈ 0.437 at the floor, the box's own at z = 5, and inset as much at the top.

**As a set:**

$$\{\,s \le x \le 20 - s,\ s \le y \le 12 - s,\ 0 \le z \le 10\,\}, \quad s = (z-5)\tan 5^\circ$$
