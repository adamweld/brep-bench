The block from the origin to (40, 30, 15), with a rectangular pocket cut into its top: the
box from (8, 8, 5) to (32, 22, 15), open at the block's top face, its floor at z = 5.

Draft the pocket's four walls by 5°, with the pull direction +z and the neutral plane z = 5, the
pocket's floor: each wall turns about its bottom edge until it leans 5° from the z direction, away
from the pocket's middle as it rises, so that the pocket widens toward its opening. The pocket's
floor and the block's faces are not drafted; the floor keeps its rectangle, and the opening in the
block's top grows to meet the drafted walls.

The result is the block less a frustum of a rectangular pyramid, upside down: the pocket's section
at height z is the rectangle from (8, 8) to (32, 22) outset (z − 5)·tan 5° on every side, so its
opening is outset 10·tan 5° ≈ 0.875.

**As a set:**

$$\bigl([0,40]\times[0,30]\times[0,15]\bigr) \setminus \{\,8 - s \le x \le 32 + s,\ 8 - s \le y \le
22 + s,\ z \ge 5\,\}, \quad s = (z-5)\tan 5^\circ$$
