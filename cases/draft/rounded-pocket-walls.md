The block from the origin to (40, 30, 15), with a pocket cut into its top: the box from
(8, 8, 5) to (32, 22, 15), its four vertical edges rounded to radius 4, open at the block's top
face, its floor at z = 5. The pocket's walls are four planes and four quarter cylinders of radius 4
about the vertical lines through (12, 12), (28, 12), (28, 18) and (12, 18), each tangent to the
planes beside it: concave rounds, seen from the block's material.

Draft all eight walls by 5°, with the pull direction +z and the neutral plane z = 5, the pocket's
floor, so that each leans 5° from the z direction, away from the pocket's middle as it rises. Each
plane turns about its bottom edge; each quarter cylinder becomes a quarter cone about the same
axis, its radius 4 + (z − 5)·tan 5° at height z, so that it stays tangent to the planes beside it.
The pocket's floor and the block's faces are not drafted; the opening in the block's top grows to
meet the drafted walls.

The result is the block less the pocket, whose section at height z is its floor's outline, the
rounded rectangle, moved (z − 5)·tan 5° outward: its straight sides outset by that and its
corners' radii 4 + (z − 5)·tan 5° about the same centers.

**As a set:**

$$\bigl([0,40]\times[0,30]\times[0,15]\bigr) \setminus \bigl\{\,d\bigl((x,y),\
[12,28]\times[12,18]\bigr) \le 4 + (z-5)\tan 5^\circ,\ z \ge 5\,\bigr\}$$
