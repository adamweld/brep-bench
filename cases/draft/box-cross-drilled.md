The box from the origin to (30, 20, 20), drilled right through along x by a hole of radius 4,
whose axis is the line y = 10, z = 10. The hole comes out through the faces x = 0 and x = 30, in a
circle on each.

Then draft those two faces by 8°, with the pull direction +z and the neutral plane z = 0, the
plane of the floor: each turns about its bottom edge until it leans 8° from the z direction,
inward as it rises. Nothing else is drafted. The hole's wall stays the cylinder of radius 4 about
its axis, trimmed now by the drafted faces, where it comes out in ellipses; the top and the sides
y = 0 and y = 20 are trimmed to the drafted faces.

The result is the prism along y whose section in any plane y = const is the trapezoid through
(0, 0), (30, 0), (30 − 20·tan 8°, 20) and (20·tan 8°, 20), each given as (x, z), from y = 0 to
y = 20, less the cylinder of radius 4 about the hole's axis. Along its axis the hole runs from
x = 10·tan 8° to x = 30 − 10·tan 8°.

**As a set:**

$$\{\,z\tan 8^\circ \le x \le 30 - z\tan 8^\circ,\ 0 \le y \le 20,\ 0 \le z \le 20\,\} \setminus
\{\,(y-10)^2 + (z-10)^2 \le 4^2\,\}$$
