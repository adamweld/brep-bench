A block, the box from the origin to (40, 30, 10), drilled right through along z by a hole of
radius 5 whose axis is the vertical line through (20, 15).

Then edit it directly: move its top face, the plane z = 10 with the hole's circle in it, up by 6,
along +z, to the plane z = 16. The faces beside the top follow it: the four sides and the hole's
wall run on up to meet it there.

The result is the box from the origin to (40, 30, 16), drilled right through along z by the hole of
radius 5 through (20, 15).

**As a set:**

$$\bigl([0,40]\times[0,30]\times[0,16]\bigr) \setminus \{\,(x-20)^2 + (y-15)^2 \le 5^2\,\}$$
