A block, the box from the origin to (40, 30, 10), with the edge where its top, z = 10, meets its
back, y = 30, rounded to radius 3: the round is a quarter cylinder whose axis is the line y = 27,
z = 7, tangent to the top along y = 27 and to the back along z = 7.

Then edit the block directly: move its top face up by 6, along +z, to the plane z = 16, and carry
the round with it. The round stays a round of radius 3 tangent to the top and the back, so it
moves up by 6 too, its axis now the line y = 27, z = 13; it is not stretched, and the back and the
two ends x = 0 and x = 40 run on up to meet the moved round and top.

The result is the box from the origin to (40, 30, 16), with the edge where its top meets its back,
y = 30, rounded to radius 3.

**As a set:**

$$\bigl([0,40]\times[0,30]\times[0,16]\bigr) \setminus \{\,y \ge 27,\ z \ge 13,\ (y-27)^2 + (z-13)^2
\ge 3^2\,\}$$
