A ball of radius 10 centered on the origin, and a solid cylinder of radius 5 whose axis is the line
x = 5, y = 0, parallel to the z axis, running from z = −12 to z = 12. Unite them.

The cylinder's radius is half the ball's and its wall passes through the ball's center, so it
touches the ball's sphere from inside at one point, (10, 0, 0), where the two surfaces are
tangent. Above and below that point the cylinder comes out through the sphere, and its ends, at
z = ±12, are outside the ball.

The sphere and the wall meet in Viviani's curve, (10 cos²t, 10 cos t sin t, 10 sin t): a figure
eight on the sphere that crosses itself at (10, 0, 0), and passes through (0, 0, 10) and
(0, 0, −10). Around the crossing point the surface is four wedges, alternating: the sphere toward
+y and toward −y, and the cylinder's wall above and below. The solid's surface is a manifold
there.

If the ball you make has poles and a seam, keep them off the curve and away from its crossing:
put the poles on the y axis, at (0, ±10, 0), and the seam through (−10, 0, 0). If the cylinder you
make has a seam, put it on the line x = 0, y = 0, the side of its wall away from (10, 0, 0).

**As a set:**

$$B_{10} \cup \{\,(x-5)^2 + y^2 \le 5^2,\ |z| \le 12\,\}$$
