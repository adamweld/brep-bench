A cylinder of radius 5 on the z axis, from z = 0 to z = 10, with a hole of radius 4 bored right
through it along z, its axis the line x = 0.999999, y = 0. The hole stays inside the cylinder,
but only just: at (5, 0, z) the wall between them is 10⁻⁶ thick, a millionth of the cylinder's
radius. If you cut the hole with a cylinder, make it run past both ends: from z = −1 to z = 11.

**As a set:**

$$\{\,\rho \le 5,\ 0 \le z \le 10\,\} \setminus \{\,(x - 0.999999)^2 + y^2 \le 4^2\,\}$$
