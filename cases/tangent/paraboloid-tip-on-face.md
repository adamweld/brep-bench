A block from (−10, −10, 0) to (10, 10, 10), united with a solid paraboloid of revolution about the
z axis whose vertex is at the origin, the middle of the block's bottom face: every point with
x² + y² ≤ 8z and z ≤ 12.5. Its side is the paraboloid x² + y² = 8z, and its top a flat disk of
radius 10 at z = 12.5.

The paraboloid's vertex touches the block's bottom face from inside at a single point, where the
two are tangent: the paraboloid is smooth there, and rises from the face only as the square of the
distance from the vertex. Up to z = 10 the paraboloid lies inside the block (its radius there is
√80 ≈ 8.94); above it the paraboloid stands out of the top face, widening from radius √80 to 10 at
z = 12.5. The vertex is not a vertex of the result: the bottom face stays a whole square.

If the paraboloid you make is the parabola turned about the z axis, the point of contact is where
the turned curve meets the axis.

**As a set:**

$$\bigl([-10,10]^2\times[0,10]\bigr) \cup \{\,\rho^2 \le 8z,\ z \le 12.5\,\}$$
