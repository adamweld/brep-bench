A cube of side 10 from (−5, −5, −10) to (5, 5, 0), its top face in the plane z = 0, and the
half-space above the plane z = y·10⁻⁶. Make the solid common to both.

The plane crosses the cube's top face along its middle line, the x axis, at a slope of 10⁻⁶ (an
angle of about 5.7·10⁻⁵ degrees), rising out of the cube toward +y and sinking into it toward −y.
What is common is a wedge under the half of the top face where y < 0: 10 long in x, 5 wide in y,
and 5·10⁻⁶ thick at its end on the face y = −5, thinning to an edge along the x axis. Its faces are
half the cube's top, the plane under it, a strip 10 × 5·10⁻⁶ of the face y = −5, and a sliver
triangle of each of the faces x = ±5.

This case is about two planes that are nearly parallel: where they meet is a well-defined line,
but a kernel that takes planes closer than its tolerance for the same plane over the whole face
finds no wedge, or the whole half. (The wedge lies at z = 0 so that its corners keep their
heights in an STL file's single-precision coordinates.)

**As a set:**

$$\bigl([-5,5]^2\times[-10,0]\bigr) \cap \{\,z \ge 10^{-6}\,y\,\}$$
