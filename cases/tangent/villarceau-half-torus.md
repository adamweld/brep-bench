A solid torus about the z axis, centered on the origin: the circle through the middle of its tube
has radius 5, and the tube has radius 3. Cut it by the plane 3x − 4z = 0, the plane through the
y axis that rises 3 in z for every 4 in x, and keep what lies on and below it: every point of the
torus with z ≤ 3x/4. If you cut with a block or a half-space, make it reach past the torus.

The plane makes the angle arcsin(3/5) with the xy plane, and 3/5 is the tube's radius over the
middle circle's, so it is a bitangent plane: it touches the torus at two points, (16/5, 0, 12/5)
and (−16/5, 0, −12/5), on the inner side of the tube, where the surface is saddle-shaped. It cuts
the torus in two circles of radius 5, Villarceau's circles, centered at (0, 3, 0) and (0, −3, 0)
in the plane, which cross each other at those two points. The cut face is what lies inside one
circle and not the other: two crescents, touching at their tips.

The two tangent points are not alike. At (16/5, 0, 12/5) the torus lies on the kept side of the
plane: around that point the surface is four wedges, alternating, the two crescents' tips and the
torus's surface between them, and the surface is a manifold there. At (−16/5, 0, −12/5) the torus
lies on the side cut away: around that point what is left is two slivers, between the plane and
the torus's surface, touching at their tips. The result is one solid, a half of the tube from one
crescent around to the other, pinched to that point, where its surface is not a manifold.

If the torus you make has a seam where the tube's section was turned from, put it in the plane
x = 0, on the side y > 0, away from the two tangent points.

**As a set:**

$$\{\,(\rho - 5)^2 + z^2 \le 3^2,\ z \le \tfrac34 x\,\}$$
