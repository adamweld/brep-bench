Two halves of the solid torus about the z axis whose tube's middle circle has radius 10 in the xy
plane and whose tube has radius 3: the first is the half with z ≥ 0, the second the half with
x ≥ 0. Unite them.

Both curved faces lie on the same torus, and they overlap on a quarter of it, where x > 0 and
z > 0. The union is the torus less the quarter where x < 0 and z < 0: three quarters of the
torus's surface; half of the ring the plane z = 0 cuts from it, between radius 7 and 13 where
x < 0; and the two half disks of radius 3 the plane x = 0 cuts from it where z < 0, centered at
(0, ±10, 0).

This case is about curved faces that coincide over part of their extent. If the tori you make
have a seam where their angle about z starts, turn the second a quarter turn about z from the
first, so that the faces that coincide are not split in the same places.

**As a set:**

$$\bigl(T \cap \{\,z \ge 0\,\}\bigr) \cup \bigl(T \cap \{\,x \ge 0\,\}\bigr), \quad T = \{\,(\rho -
10)^2 + z^2 \le 3^2\,\}$$
