A cube of side 10 centered on the origin, from (−5, −5, −5) to (5, 5, 5), united with a solid
cylinder of radius 5 on the x axis, from x = −10 to x = 10.

Inside the cube the cylinder is inscribed in it: its wall touches each of the cube's faces
y = ±5 and z = ±5 from inside along a whole line, the middle line of the face parallel to x,
where the plane and the cylinder are tangent. Beyond the faces x = ±5 the cylinder stands out of
the cube as a stub 5 long at each end. The union is the cube with a round stub on two opposite
faces; each of those faces is left as a square less the stub's disk. The four lines of contact
are not edges of the result: each of the four faces it touches stays one whole square.

If the cylinder you make has a seam, turn it so that the seam does not lie on one of the lines of
contact: put it at 45° to them, along the line y = z of the wall.

**As a set:**

$$[-5,5]^3 \cup \{\,y^2 + z^2 \le 5^2,\ |x| \le 10\,\}$$
