Two halves of the ball of radius 5 centered on the origin: the first is the half with z ≥ 0, the
second the half with x ≥ 0. Unite them.

Both curved faces lie on the same sphere, and they overlap on a quarter of it, where x > 0 and
z > 0. The union is the ball less the quarter where x < 0 and z < 0: three quarters of the
sphere, in one face, and two half disks of radius 5 meeting at a right angle along the y axis, the
half of the plane z = 0 where x < 0 and the half of the plane x = 0 where z < 0.

This case is about curved faces that coincide over part of their extent, each parametrized its own
way. If the balls you make have poles, put the first's on the z axis, at (0, 0, ±5), and the
second's on the x axis, at (±5, 0, 0), so that each half's flat face holds the other's poles.

**As a set:**

$$\bigl(B_5 \cap \{\,z \ge 0\,\}\bigr) \cup \bigl(B_5 \cap \{\,x \ge 0\,\}\bigr)$$
