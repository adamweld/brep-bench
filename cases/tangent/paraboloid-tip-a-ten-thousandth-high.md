The solid paraboloid of `geometry/paraboloid`, every point with x² + y² ≤ 8z and z ≤ 8, and the
half-space below the plane z = 10⁻⁴. Make the solid common to both: the paraboloid's tip,
every point with x² + y² ≤ 8z and z ≤ 10⁻⁴. If you cut with a block, make it reach past the
paraboloid on every side but its top.

The plane meets the paraboloid in a circle of radius √(8·10⁻⁴) ≈ 0.0283 about the z axis, the
tip's rim, where the paraboloid leaves the plane at about 0.4°. The tip is a disk 0.057 across
over a bowl 10⁻⁴ deep.

This case is about finding that small loop on a surface no kernel meets in closed form unless it
knows paraboloids: a search that samples the surface coarsely can step over it and find nothing,
or only the vertex. If the paraboloid you make is the parabola turned about the z axis, the loop
runs around the vertex, where the turned curve meets the axis.

**As a set:**

$$\{\,\rho^2 \le 8z,\ z \le 10^{-4}\,\}$$
