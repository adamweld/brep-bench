Two balls: one of radius 5.511 centered on the origin, and one of radius 3.317 centered at
(4.231, 3.467, 2.653), about 6.08 from it, so that they overlap but neither holds the other. Make
the lens common to both.

`boolean/sphere-lens` with its balls unequal and the line between their centers off every axis, so
the circle where their spheres meet lies in a plane aslant to x, y and z.

**As a set:**

$$B_{5.511}(0,0,0) \cap B_{3.317}(4.231,\ 3.467,\ 2.653)$$
