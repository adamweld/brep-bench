A ball of radius 10 centered on the origin, with 62 dimples. Each dimple is cut by a ball of
radius 1.2 whose center is 10.6 from the origin, along one of 62 directions: toward the 12
vertices, the 30 midpoints of the edges and the 20 centers of the faces of a regular icosahedron
centered on the origin. Take the icosahedron whose vertices are (0, ±1, ±φ), (±1, ±φ, 0) and
(±φ, 0, ±1), φ = (1 + √5)/2. Cut the 62 balls from the big one, each its own cut.

Each small ball meets the big sphere in a circle of radius about 1.0, 9.949 from the origin, and
leaves a dimple 0.55 deep. The nearest two directions are about 20.9° apart, and each dimple's
rim is about 5.8° across seen from the center, so no two dimples meet.

If the balls you make have poles, put each ball's on the vertical through its center. The rims
then run past the poles of the small balls at every distance, and some pass within a few degrees
of one without reaching it.

**As a set:**

$$B_{10} \setminus \bigcup_{i=1}^{62} B_{1.2}(10.6\,u_i), \quad u_i \text{ the 62 unit directions}$$
