Twelve balls of radius 3, their centers evenly spaced on the circle of radius 10 about the z axis
in the plane z = 0, the first at (10, 0, 0). Neighboring balls, whose centers are 2·10·sin 15°
apart, overlap in a lens; no ball meets any other but its two neighbors. Join them, one after
another, into one ring.

**As a set:**

$$\bigcup_{k=0}^{11} B_3\bigl(10\cos 30^\circ k,\ 10\sin 30^\circ k,\ 0\bigr)$$
