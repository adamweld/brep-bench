A cube from the origin to (30, 30, 30), drilled right through by fifteen holes of radius 2.5, all
of them cut from it:

- three along x, their axes the lines y = 7.5, 15 and 22.5 at z = 15;
- three along y, their axes the lines x = 7.5, 15 and 22.5 at z = 15;
- nine along z, their axes the lines through (x, y, 0) for x and y each 7.5, 15 and 22.5.

Each of the nine points (x, y, 15) with x and y in 7.5, 15 and 22.5 is on three of the holes' axes,
one along each of x, y and z: there three holes of one radius cross square to each other, and
each pair of them meets in two ellipses that cross. No two holes meet anywhere else. If you cut the
holes with cylinders, make them run past the faces at both ends.

**As a set:**

$$[0,30]^3 \setminus \Bigl(\,\bigcup_{a \in A} \{\,(y-a)^2 + (z-15)^2 \le 2.5^2\,\} \cup \bigcup_{a
\in A} \{\,(x-a)^2 + (z-15)^2 \le 2.5^2\,\} \cup \bigcup_{a, b \in A} \{\,(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 \le
2.5^2\,\}\Bigr), \quad A = \{7.5,\ 15,\ 22.5\}$$
