"""What the OCCT implementations of the swept cases share: everything a solid passes through as it
moves, built from OCCT's sweeps of faces.

OCCT sweeps no solid: BRepPrimAPI_MakePrism and MakeRevol answer "Solids are not Processed", and
BRepOffsetAPI_MakePipe "profile contains solids". But each sweeps a face, to the solid that face
passes through, and what a solid passes through follows from what its faces do, by elementary
geometry (SPEC.md, "A swept solid"):

- A point the moving solid covers at some instant is either inside it where it starts, or enters
  it later, and then it enters across the solid's boundary where the boundary moves towards it:
  where the face's outward normal leads the motion (makes an acute angle with the velocity). So
  everything the solid passes through is the solid where it starts, with what its *leading*
  faces sweep.
- A face leads on one side of its *contact*, the curve along which its normal is square to the
  velocity, and trails on the other. Split along its contact, each piece either leads all over or
  trails all over, and a leading piece never moves back over where it has been, so it sweeps to a
  solid without folding. Each case names the surfaces that split its tool's faces along their
  contact, from the elementary geometry of those faces, and says why beside them. `leads`
  checks that every piece leads or trails all over, so that a contact a case misses is a
  failure, not a wrong solid.
- A face the motion keeps in itself (a flat face sliding or turning in its own plane, a cylinder
  sliding along its axis, a surface of revolution turning about its own axis) neither leads nor
  trails, and sweeps nothing of its own.

`slid`, `turned` and `threaded` (`screwed`) give the solid where the tool starts and what its
leading faces sweep, for a slide (BRepPrimAPI_MakePrism), a turn about a fixed axis
(BRepPrimAPI_MakeRevol) and a turn about the z axis while rising along it
(BRepOffsetAPI_MakePipeShell, along the path a point of the tool takes); `united` makes them one
solid, and `cut` takes them from a block one after another. `flat_contacts_turned` and
`flat_contacts_screwed` give the planes along which a turn and a screw run along a tool's flat
faces.
