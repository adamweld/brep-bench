//! A ring sector (radii 8 to 12 about z, z from −1 to 1, polar angle 0° to 60°) with a helical
//! groove milled through it by a frustum about the vertical line through (10, 0), radius 0.4 at
//! z = −0.6 widening to 1 at z = 1.4, screwed about z — right-handed, rising 2 a turn — from a turn
//! of −140° to +140°.
//!
//! Refused by the kernel. `cut_from` takes the frustum (a cone about an axis along the screw's) and
//! builds a solid, but its own judge finds it disagreeing with the sweep's membership at a witness
//! point and refuses it rather than return it wrong (`Unbuilt::Wrong`).
