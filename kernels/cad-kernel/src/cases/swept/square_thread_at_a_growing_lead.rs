//! A rod, the cylinder of radius 5 about z from z = 0 to 20, threaded by the bar 4 ≤ x ≤ 12,
//! −8 ≤ y ≤ 8, −1 ≤ z ≤ 1 carried so that, turned by θ about z (right-handed), it has risen
//! 6s + 0.3s², s = θ/360°, θ from −90° to 1260°: a lead growing from about 6 to about 8.
//!
//! Refused by the kernel. A screw whose lead grows is no constant twist, so the sweep takes the
//! kernel's road for any other rigid motion (K2), which reads the tool as a convex solid of
//! revolution and refuses the bar, a box (`Unbuilt::Curved` at its corner).
