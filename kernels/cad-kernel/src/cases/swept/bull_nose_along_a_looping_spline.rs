//! A block, the box (−10, −10, −8)–(30, 25, 0), with a groove cut into its top by a bull-nose mill
//! — radius 2 from 1.5 below the top to 5 above it, its bottom corner rounded to 0.5 — whose
//! upright axis rides the cubic Bézier curve (0, 0, 0), (30, 20, 0), (−10, 20, 0), (20, 0, 0) in
//! the top from its first end to its last, its foot on the curve. The curve crosses itself, so the
//! groove does, and turns tighter than the mill.
//!
//! The motion is the mill carried without turning along the curve, the kernel's own B-spline: no
//! slide, turn or screw, nor a path of them, so a motion the kernel reads by evaluating it
//! (`Trajectory::General`, its K2 road), which takes a convex tool of revolution.
//!
//! Refused by the kernel: the sheet each instant's contact sweeps cannot be fitted to the
//! arrangement's tolerance (`Unbuilt::Failed`: it fits only to about 1.9 along the loop and 1.4
//! along the roll), before its fold or its return onto itself is reached.
