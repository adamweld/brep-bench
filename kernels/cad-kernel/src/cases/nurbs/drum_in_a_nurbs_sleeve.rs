//! The drum of radius 5 on the z axis from z = 0 to 10 united with a sleeve round its middle: every
//! point between 5 and 7 from the axis with 2 ≤ z ≤ 8, its outer side a cylinder, its ends flat
//! annuli, and its bore a rational B-spline surface lying exactly on the drum's cylinder (the
//! rational quadratic circle of nine control points from (0, 5) round to it, degree 1 along z).
//!
//! Refused, by the kernel's Boolean: the sleeve is built and sewn shut (its volume 144π, valid),
//! but the union says "a piece of a cylinder touches `bore` (a bspline) at (−5, 0, 2.51) along no
//! face of either: move the one off the other's face, or into it" — it does not recognise the
//! B-spline bore as lying on the drum's cylinder.
